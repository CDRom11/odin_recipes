COMPLETED PROJECTS


CURRENT PROJECT:
    Project Recipes:
    It’s time to put all of the HTML knowledge you have been acquiring so far into practice. In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.

    The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time you’ve finished. Not unless you’re into brutalist web design that is.

    But It’s important to keep in mind this project is just to build your HTML chops, we will revisit this project in the future to style it up with CSS.

    Iteration 1: Initial Structure (Create initial page with heading)
    Iteration 2: Recipe Page (Create page for a recipe and link to main page)
    Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content (Add image and steps to recipe page)
    Iteration 4: Add More Recipes (Create two more recipe pages)
